# API

RSA CLI is a command-line tool, but also for you to integrate to your project.

## Get Started

To install RSA CLI as an API dependency to your project, use npm or Yarn:

```sh
$ npm install rsa-cli
# or
$ yarn add rsa-cli
```

Then import RSA CLI to your code:

```js
const RSA_CLI = require('rsa-cli')
```

## Docs

API docs are right in the commands docs, [check them out](commands/).
